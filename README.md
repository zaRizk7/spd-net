# SPDNet implementations

Neural nets to efficiently process SPD matrix.

# Disclaimer

- I don't plan to make this into official package.
- This repo is more of a way for me to revise my PyTorch coding skills and understanding ML papers.
- I think these kinds of networks is interesting due to how efficient it is in modelling types of features used in signal processing, notably functional connectivity for fMRI.
- I do plan to document this code as I implement several variations to use for my own research, it is important to have an easy to use implementation to work with.
