# SPDNet implementations

Neural nets to efficiently process SPD matrix.

I don't plan to make this into official package, this is just my practice to implement more advanced neural networks from scratch with clean code and easy to follow implementation. I mainly interested in these kinds of network due to how efficient it is processing multi-source time series which is then used to produce covariance matrices. It is commonly used to model fMRI's functional connectivity or for ECG/EEG data.
